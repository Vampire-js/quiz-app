Octopuses are truly remarkable creatures, known for their intelligence, ability to camouflage, and unique physiology. One of the most interesting aspects of their biology is their circulatory system, which features three hearts.

Two of these hearts are dedicated to pumping blood to the gills. In the gills, the blood absorbs oxygen from the water, a critical process for any aquatic animal. The third heart is responsible for circulating this oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body.

What’s particularly intriguing is how their hearts function differently when swimming. When an octopus swims, the heart that supplies blood to the body actually stops beating. This is one reason why octopuses prefer crawling along the ocean floor rather than swimming; swimming can be exhausting for them. Their bodies are soft and flexible, allowing them to squeeze into tight spaces, which is an advantage when evading predators or hunting for prey.

Additionally, octopus blood is not red like that of humans; instead, it’s a bluish color due to a copper-rich protein called hemocyanin, which is more efficient than hemoglobin at transporting oxygen in cold and low-oxygen environments. This adaptation helps them thrive in the diverse habitats they occupy, from coral reefs to deep-sea environments.

Overall, the octopus is a stunning example of how evolution shapes the physiology of animals to suit their environments. Their unique circulatory system is just one of many features that contribute to their survival and adaptability in the ocean.
